# Transit-Vs-Unemployment-Data-Before-and-After-Covid

### By Cole Wiltse

## Description

This project analyzes public transit and unemployment data in Canada before and after the covid-19 pandemic in order to determine if there is a trend between the two datasets. The program accepts a variety of filters from user input such as time range, age, sex, region, and more. Note that the date range is only from 2017-01 to 2021-08.

## Install and Running Insructions

This program runs on Python 3.10.

Note that the unemployment dataset is too large for github. Instead, please download the dataset from the following link and copy it to the data directory on your local copy of this project. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p4bh-8C1VrSUecCxFoHWVfnEghGUp7GC?usp=sharing

Also make sure you install all the external libraries from the requirements.txt file.
